# TIC-TAC-TOE

A simple two-player game to score three in a row on a 3X3 board.

## Description and game play
Game play consists of two players taking turns to put their symbol - either a circle, or a cross, on a 3X3 grid,  trying to score three of the same symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The first to do so is the winner.
